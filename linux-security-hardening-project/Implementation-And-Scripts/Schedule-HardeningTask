Step 1: Open the Crontab Editor

To edit the cron schedule for the current user, run the following command:

sudo crontab -e
	• sudo: Ensures the scripts run with the necessary permissions.
	• crontab -e: Opens the cron table editor.

Step 2: Add Cron Jobs
Add the following two lines to schedule the scripts as specified:

	1. Script 1 - Run Once a Month on the First Day of the Month:
	
		○ Schedule the script hardening_script1.sh to run at 12:00 AM on the 1st of every month.

0 0 1 * * /hardening_script1.sh
	2. Script 2 - Run Once a Week on Mondays:
	
		○ Schedule the script hardening_script2.sh to run at 12:00 AM every Monday.

0 0 * * 1 /hardening_script2.sh

Final Crontab File Example
Your crontab file will look something like this:

# Run hardening_script1.sh once a month on the 1st at 12:00 AM
0 0 1 * * /path/to/hardening_script1.sh
# Run hardening_script2.sh once a week on Mondays at 12:00 AM
0 0 * * 1 /path/to/hardening_script2.sh

Step 3: Save and Exit
	1. After adding the lines, save the file:
		○ If you’re using nano, press Ctrl+O to save, then Ctrl+X to exit.
		
	2. Verify that the cron jobs were added:

sudo crontab -l

The output should show the scheduled tasks.

Step 4: Ensure the Scripts Are Executable
Make sure both scripts have executable permissions:

chmod +x /path/to/hardening_script1.sh
chmod +x /path/to/hardening_script2.sh

Step 5: Verify Cron Service
Ensure the cron service is running:
	• Check status:

sudo systemctl status cron
	
	• Start and enable the service if it’s not running:

sudo systemctl start cron
sudo systemctl enable cron


Summary
	1. Open the crontab editor with sudo crontab -e.
	2. Add the following cron jobs:

plaintext
Copy code
0 0 1 * * /path/to/hardening_script1.sh
0 0 * * 1 /path/to/hardening_script2.sh
	3. Ensure the scripts are executable and the cron service is running.
Your scripts will now run:
	• Script 1: At 12:00 AM on the 1st of every month.
	• Script 2: At 12:00 AM every Monday.

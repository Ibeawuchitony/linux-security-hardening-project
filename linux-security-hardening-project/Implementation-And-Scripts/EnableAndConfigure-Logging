Step 1: Configure journald.conf Settings
	The journald.conf file controls the system journal (systemd-journald), which manages logging.
	
		1. Open the journald.conf file for editing:
			sudo nano /etc/systemd/journald.conf
		2. Find and edit the following settings. Uncomment the lines (remove the #) and set the specified values:
			Storage=persistent
			SystemMaxUse=300M
		○ Storage=persistent: Saves logs locally to /var/log/journal/ so they persist after reboots.
		○ SystemMaxUse=300M: Limits the maximum disk space used by the system journal to 300 MB.
			
		3. Save the changes and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X).
		
		4. Restart the systemd-journald service to apply the changes:
			sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald
		5. Verify the changes:
			sudo journalctl --disk-usage

The output should show the disk usage and confirm the 300 MB limit.
	
	Step 2: Configure Log Rotation in /etc/logrotate.conf
	
	The logrotate utility manages log files to prevent them from consuming too much disk space.
	
		1. Open the logrotate.conf file for editing:
			sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf
		2. Find and update the following settings:
			○ Change rotation frequency from weekly to daily: Replace:
					weekly
					With:
					daily
			○ Rotate logs after 7 days: Add or update the rotate option to:
					rotate 7

Final Example of /etc/logrotate.conf:

# Log rotation settings
daily
rotate 7
create
compress
include /etc/logrotate.d
			
			○ daily: Rotates logs every day.
			○ rotate 7: Keeps logs for 7 days (rotates out old logs).
			○ create: Creates a new log file after rotation.
			○ compress: Compresses old log files to save space.
		3. Save the changes and exit.
	
	Step 3: Test Log Rotation Configuration
	To ensure the new settings work correctly:
		1. Run logrotate in debug mode:
		2. sudo logrotate -d /etc/logrotate.conf
		
			○ -d: Runs in debug mode (does not make changes but shows what would happen).
			○ Verify the output shows logs being rotated daily and retaining 7 rotations.
			
		3. Force log rotation to test:

sudo logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.conf
		
			○ -f: Forces the log rotation immediately.
			
		4. Check the rotated logs:

ls -lh /var/log
	
	Summary of Steps
		1. Edit /etc/systemd/journald.conf:

Storage=persistent
SystemMaxUse=300M

Restart the service:

sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald
		
		2. Edit /etc/logrotate.conf:
			○ Change to daily rotation.
			○ Rotate logs for 7 days.
			
		3. Test logrotate:

sudo logrotate -d /etc/logrotate.conf
sudo logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.conf
		
	By completing these steps, you ensure logs are persisted, limited to 300 MB of space, rotated daily, and retained for 7 days. This prevents excessive disk usage while maintaining a manageable log history.

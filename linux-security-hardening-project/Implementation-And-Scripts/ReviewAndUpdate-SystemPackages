	1. Update the Package Manager: Run the following command to refresh the package lists:
		a. sudo apt update
	2. Upgrade All Installed Packages: Update all packages to their latest versions with:
		a. sudo apt upgrade -y
	3. Generate a List of Installed Packages
		a. Create a file called package_list.txt containing all installed packages:
			i. apt list --installed > package_list.txt
		b. Verify the file was created:
			i. cat package_list.txt
	4. Identify and Remove Insecure Packages
		a. Search for Telnet and RSH-Client: Check if telnet or rsh-client are installed by running
			i. grep -E "telnet|rsh-client" package_list.txt
		b. If any of these packages appear in the list, remove them with
			i. sudo apt remove --purge telnet rsh-client -y
		c. Clean Up Unnecessary Dependencies: Run the following command to remove unused dependencies:
			i. sudo apt autoremove -y
			
	5. Why Telnet and RSH-Client Are Insecure:
		Telnet:
			• Sends data, including passwords, in plaintext.
			• Makes it vulnerable to interception (e.g., packet sniffing).
		• RSH-Client:
			○ Provides remote shell access without encryption.
			○ Vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, as credentials are sent unencrypted.
	Summary: Both tools lack encryption, making them obsolete and insecure in modern systems.

	6. Install Security Hardening Packages
		Install the following packages to improve system security:
			• UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall): A user-friendly firewall management tool.
			• Lynis: A system and security auditing tool.
			• Tripwire: A file integrity monitoring tool.
		Run the following command to install all three packages:
			sudo apt install ufw lynis tripwire -y
	7. Research and Document Hardening Features
		UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall):
			• Provides an easy way to manage iptables rules.
			• Allows administrators to configure inbound and outbound firewall rules.
			• Helps block unauthorized access while allowing trusted connections.
			• Example: Allow SSH access while blocking other ports:
				sudo ufw allow 22
				sudo ufw enable
				
		Lynis:
			• Audits system security settings and configurations.
			• Performs checks for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and security weaknesses.
			• Generates a report with recommendations to harden the system.
			• Run Lynis with:
				□ sudo lynis audit system
		Tripwire:
			• Monitors file integrity and detects unauthorized changes to critical system files.
			• Useful for intrusion detection and post-breach analysis.
			• Initializes with:
				sudo tripwire --init
				sudo tripwire --check
	8. Final Verification
		a. Verify installed packages:
			i. dpkg -l | grep -E "ufw|lynis|tripwire"
		b. Ensure telnet and rsh-client are no longer installed:
			i. dpkg -l | grep -E "telnet|rsh-client"

To update or configure password hashing algorithms in Linux, you typically modify the PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module) configuration files and ensure the correct hashing method is in place.
Modern systems use strong hashing algorithms like SHA-512 by default, but you can explicitly configure or change it.

Steps to Update Password Hashing Configuration
1. Edit the pam_unix Configuration
The pam_unix module handles password authentication and hashing. Modify the file where pam_unix is configured:
For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems, edit:

sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-password
For Red Hat/CentOS-based systems, edit:

sudo nano /etc/pam.d/system-auth

2. Update the Hashing Algorithm
Find the line containing pam_unix.so and ensure the hashing method is explicitly set.
Example Line:

password sufficient pam_unix.so sha512
Here:
	• sha512: Specifies the SHA-512 hashing algorithm.

3. Verify or Update the System-Wide Default Hashing Algorithm
For system-wide control over password hashing, configure the /etc/login.defs file.
Edit the file:

sudo nano /etc/login.defs
Look for the ENCRYPT_METHOD parameter. Update it to use SHA-512:

ENCRYPT_METHOD SHA512
Alternatively, you can set other algorithms such as:
	• SHA256
	• MD5 (not recommended due to weak security)
	• DES (legacy and insecure)

4. Update Existing User Passwords
Once the hashing configuration is updated, it will apply only to new or updated passwords.
Force users to update their passwords to apply the new hashing algorithm:

sudo passwd username
Repeat this for all users as needed.

5. Verify the Password Hash Algorithm
To verify the password hash algorithm being used:
	1. Check the /etc/shadow file:

sudo grep username /etc/shadow
	2. Look at the hash prefix:
		○ $6$: SHA-512
		○ $5$: SHA-256
		○ $1$: MD5
		○ No prefix: DES (insecure legacy)
Example:

text
Copy code
username:$6$abc123...:19053:0:99999:7:::
Here $6$ confirms that SHA-512 is being used.

Summary of Key Files:
	• PAM Configuration: /etc/pam.d/common-password (Debian) or /etc/pam.d/system-auth (Red Hat)
	• System-Wide Defaults: /etc/login.defs
	• Password Hashes: /etc/shadow
Updating to SHA-512 is the recommended best practice for secure password hashing.

Explanation of the Script
	1. Remove Terminated Staff:
		○ The script loops through the TERMINATED_USERS array.
		○ The userdel -r command removes the user and their home directory.
	2. Lock Accounts for Staff on Temporary Leave:
		○ The script loops through the ON_LEAVE_USERS array.
		○ The passwd -l command locks their account, disabling login.
	3. Unlock Accounts for Employed Staff:
		○ The script loops through the EMPLOYED_USERS array.
		○ The passwd -u command unlocks their accounts, enabling login.
	4. Move Marketing Employees to the Research Group:
		○ If the research group doesn’t exist, it creates it with groupadd.
		○ Then, it adds the marketing employees to the research group using usermod -aG.
	5. Remove the Marketing Group:
		○ If the marketing group exists, it deletes it with groupdel.

Assumptions
	• The users already exist on the system, and their group memberships can be checked with id.
	• sudo or root privileges are required to manage users, groups, and permissions.
	• In a real-world setup, this script would likely read user data from a database or file
